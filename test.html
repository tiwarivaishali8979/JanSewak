            <div class="info"><p>Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique identification number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to residents of India. It is one of the world's largest biometric identification systems and serves as a proof of identity and address for individuals.

<br><br><span><b>Purpose:</b></span><br><br>
<pre id="codeBlock">
Aadhaar is primarily used as a means of identification for Indian residents. It is used to streamline the delivery of various government welfare and subsidy programs.</pre>
<br><br><span><b>Biometric Data:</b></span><br><br>

The Aadhaar card is linked to an individual's biometric and demographic data, including fingerprints and iris scans, to ensure accuracy and uniqueness.
<br><br><span><b>Information on Aadhaar Card:</b></span><br><br>

The Aadhaar card includes details such as the individual's name, Aadhaar number, photograph, gender, date of birth, and address. The card also features a QR code for easy verification.
<br><br><span><b>Voluntary Enrollment:</b></span><br><br>

While Aadhaar enrollment is widespread, it is not mandatory. However, there are instances where linking Aadhaar is required for certain services and benefits.
<br><br><span><b>Aadhaar Authentication:</b></span><br><br>

Aadhaar is used for authentication purposes, enabling individuals to prove their identity or access services by providing their Aadhaar number and undergoing biometric verification.
<br><br><span><b>Government Programs and Services:</b>b></span><br><br>

Aadhaar is linked to various government programs such as Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), where subsidies and benefits are directly transferred to the bank accounts of eligible individuals.
<br><br><span><b>Bank Account Linking:</b></span><br><br>

The government has mandated the linking of Aadhaar to bank accounts to curb fraudulent activities and ensure accurate targeting of subsidies.
<br><br><span><b>Mobile Number Linking:<b></span><br><br>

Aadhaar is often linked to mobile numbers to maintain accurate records and enhance security.
<br><br><span><b>E-Aadhaar:</b></span><br><br>

Individuals can download an electronic version of their Aadhaar, known as an E-Aadhaar, from the official UIDAI website using the Aadhaar number or the Enrollment ID.
<br><br><span><b>Privacy and Security:</b></span><br><br>

The UIDAI has implemented various security measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of Aadhaar data. Biometric information is securely stored and used only for verification purposes.
<br><br><span><b>Legal Framework:</b></span><br><br>

The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits, and Services) Act, 2016, provides the legal framework for the issuance and use of Aadhaar numbers.
It's important to note that the use of Aadhaar has been the subject of discussions related to privacy concerns, and the Supreme Court of India has made certain rulings to address these issues. Individuals in India are encouraged to be aware of the latest regulations and use their Aadhaar responsibly.
